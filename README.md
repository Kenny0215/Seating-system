# Bitwise Brotherhood (Seating System)

The Bitwise Brotherhood Students' Seating System is a simple yet effective tool for managing student data. It serves as a practical example for learning basic C++ programming concepts and demonstrates the implementation of sorting and searching algorithms in a real-world scenario. The project can be extended to include additional features such as adding or removing students, saving data to files and more advanced search options.

In details, this system is using sequential search and bubble sort algorithms to arrange the height of student either ascending or descending of user's choice. Below are the details explanation of these algorithms used in the system:

1) Student Sorting:

-Users can sort a list of students based on their height in either ascending or descending order.

-The sorted list provides a clear visualization of student heights, aiding in easy data comparison and analysis.

2) Student Searching:
   
-The application allows users to search for a student by their name.

-If the student is found, the system displays their height and seating position in the list.

3) Interactive Menu:
   
-A user-friendly menu guides users through the available options, making the application easy to navigate.

-Options to restart the program or exit ensure flexibility in usage.

This project is ideal for beginners looking to enhance their programming skills and gain hands-on experience with data management and algorithm implementation in C++.
